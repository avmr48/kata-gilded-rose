# Kata Gilded Rose

![Java CI](https://github.com/avmr48/kata-gilded-rose/workflows/Java%20CI/badge.svg)

Before refactoring:

1. exploratory tests
2. mutation testing
3. ~~unit test (junit 4)~~
4. nested parameterized unit tests (junit 5)

Refactored without strategy pattern because it is simple
but I should do it some day in another branch to compare the trade offs of both solutions. 

TODO
- property based testing (quick check)
